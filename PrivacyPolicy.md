# CIFilterBox Privacy Policy

CIFilterBox does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data. It does not have access—and will never request access—to any personal data stored on your machine.

CIFilterBox does not request any special permissions. It can access only the image files that you explicitly load via the app, and only for the duration of the current app session.

The sharing function is handled by MacOS directly, so CIFilterBox has no access to your contacts or anything else that appears in the sharing menu.

The preferences file is stored locally on your machine and you may delete it at any time.
